## How it works

1. **Obtaining Black Stones**: Players must first obtain Black Stones by killing mobs. Different mobs have different chances of dropping Black Stones.

2. **Enhancement GUI**: Players can access the enhancement GUI to start the enhancement process. They need to place the item they want to enhance and the corresponding Black Stone in the GUI.

3. **Enhancement levels**: Each enhancement level has a specific success chance, making higher levels more challenging to achieve. The enhancement level is displayed on the item with a unique name and color.

4. **Success or Failure**: When the enhancement process is initiated, there's a countdown before the result is revealed. If successful, the item is enhanced to the next level, and a success message is broadcasted to the server. If the enhancement fails, a failure message is broadcasted, and the item remains at its current level.

5. **Custom enchantments**: As items are enhanced, they receive custom enchantments depending on their enhancement level. This makes the items more powerful and valuable.

6. **Cool particle effects**: When players successfully enhance an item, cool particle effects will appear around them, adding a visual element of excitement and satisfaction.

## Why Blackstone Enhancer?

Blackstone Enhancer is designed to make the enhancement process more engaging, challenging, and rewarding. By adding a layer of depth and complexity to the game, players are encouraged to invest time and effort into enhancing their weapons and armor, making the gameplay experience more enjoyable and meaningful.
