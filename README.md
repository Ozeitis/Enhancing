# Enhancing

Enhancing is a Minecraft Spigot plugin that adds a challenging and engaging enchantment system to your server. By making the process of enchanting items more meaningful and fun, players are encouraged to grind and take on new challenges. This plugin introduces Black Stones, which are used to enhance weapons and armor to higher levels, adding a whole new layer of depth to the game.

This plugin was inspired by the [Black Desert Online](https://playblackdesert.com/)'s enhancing system.

**Please keep in mind this is my first ever Spigot plugin :)**

## Features

- Obtain Black Stones by killing mobs
- Different types of Black Stones for weapons and armor
- Unique enhancement levels with unique names and colors
- Each enhancement level has a specific success chance
- Configurable vanilla enchantments for each enhancement level
- Engaging enhancement animation
- Broadcasts enhancement success or failure messages
- Cool particle effects on successful enhancements

## How it works

1. **Obtaining Black Stones**: Players must first obtain Black Stones by killing mobs. Different mobs have different chances of dropping Black Stones. Base armor and weapon Black Stones are used to enhance gear from levels 1-15. Concentrated Black Stones are used to enhance gear to the harder levels PRI-PEN (16-20).

2. **Enhancement GUI**: Players can access the enhancement GUI to start the enhancement process. They need to place the item they want to enhance and the corresponding Black Stone in the GUI.

3. **Enhancement levels**: Each enhancement level has a specific success chance, which is configurable, making higher levels more challenging to achieve. After level 15, players need to use Concentrated Black Stones to advance to the next levels. Failing an enhancement attempt after level 15 will result in losing an enchantment level; for example, if you fail a DUO (level 17) enhancement attempt, you will be reverted back to PRI (level 16) enhancement level. The enhancement level is displayed on the item with a unique name and color.

4. **Success or Failure**: When the enhancement process is initiated, there's a countdown before the result is revealed. If successful, the item is enhanced to the next level, and a success message is broadcasted to the server. If the enhancement fails, a failure message is broadcasted, and the item remains at its current level.

5. **Enchantments per Level**: Each enhancement level have specific enchnats assigned to it,w hich is configured in the plugins config file. This makes the items more powerful and valuable.

6. **Cool particle effects**: When players successfully enhance an item, cool particle effects will appear around them, adding a visual element of excitement and satisfaction.

7. **Blocks Enchnating Table**: Players are now not allowed to use the enchanting table for items that can be enhanced, forcing users to use Enhancing progression fpr enchants.
